For my MSc research thesis, I designed, developed, and user-tested the first-ever RPG companion app to support fast, fluid edits to game rules at runtime -- without stopping gameplay.

The central responsibility of a Game Master (GM) is being a real-time game designer: he must accomodate open-ended player action by expanding his RPG rules on the fly.  In traditional RPGs, rules are prose that the GM interprets, so he can make sweeping or specific changes at any time by speaking a few words.

RPG companion apps (including virtual tabletops, or VTTs) offer important advances like automatic rule interpretation, but they sacrifice the traditional flexibility of analog play. If playing via an app, even the slightest rule change would require a GM to:

- shut down the app
- hunt down the code controlling rules you want to change, amidst mountains of platform boilerplate
- write the necessary code, with no game-specific feedback about the impacts of the new rules
- bump the version of your rule code bundle and upload it to a host where players can download it
- restart the app server and tell the players to reconnect

This would take tens of minutes at best, and would bring the gameplay to a total halt, so nobody does it. But that slowness is primarily owed to how these apps implement game rules, and what interfaces they offer GMs for designing rules. A companion app could be designed to preserve GMs' roles as run-time game designers, while making that role easier with computational support, such as identifying content that would be affected by rule changes, visualizing probabilities for dice rolls and other randomizers, and running WIP rules in a testing sandbox against copies of live data.

## About Me
I'm a product-minded software engineer. I don't just write code: I gain domain expertise, I talk to users, and I build the right mix of what they want and what they need.

Some past experiences:
- Built data pipelines to take a team's ETL operations from "multiple crashes per day" to "we forget it's there"
- Set up CI/CD and other infrastructure automation for worry-free deployments
-  Wrote and programmed a text adventure starring my college roommate (as a surprise birthday gift)
-  Transformed board and roleplaying games (RPGs) into digital experiences
