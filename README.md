I'm a product-minded software engineer. I don't just write code: I gain domain expertise, I talk to users, and I build the right mix of what they want and what they need.

Some past experiences:
- Built data pipelines to take a team's ETL operations from "multiple crashes per day" to "we forget it's there"
- Set up CI/CD and other infrastructure automation for worry-free deployments
-  Wrote and programmed a text adventure starring my college roommate (as a surprise birthday gift)
-  Transformed board and roleplaying games (RPGs) into digital experiences

For my MSc in Computational Media (read: applied CS), I designed, developed, and user-tested the first-ever RPG app to support fast, fluid additions to game rules at runtime. To allow open-ended player action, it's essentially mandatory for a Game Master (GM) to expand his RPG system during play -- but no existing app prioritized giving GMs power-user design tools for this fundamental use case.
