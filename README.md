I'm a product-minded software engineer. I don't just write code: I gain domain expertise, I talk to users, and I build the right mix of what they want and what they need.

On a technical level, I have built data pipelines, written and programmed a text adventure, set up CI/CD and infrastructure automation, and transformed board and roleplaying games (RPGs) into digital experiences.

For my MSc in Computational Media (read: applied CS), I designed, developed, and user-tested the first-ever RPG app to support fast, fluid additions to game rules at runtime. To allow open-ended player action, it's essentially mandatory for a Game Master (GM) to expand his RPG system during play -- but no existing app prioritized giving GMs power-user design tools for this fundamental use case.
