Here are explanations and screenshots for recent software work which I'm proud of.

## Master's Thesis: The Computer-Driven, Human-Controlled TTRPG

For my [MSc research thesis]([url](https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/static/maxwell-joslyn-ms-thesis-v1.0.3.pdf)), I designed, coded, and user-tested ROLEPLAYINGGAME[^1], the first-ever tabletop RPG companion app to support runtime editing of game rules and content without stopping gameplay. I aimed to combine the flexibility of traditional RPGs with the complex, real-time rule evaluation of videogames.

## Computational TTRPG Tools

My master's project grew out of a long-standing personal quest: creating a custom tabletop RPG with rules so detailed they could only exist as software. Before starting my MSc, I had already developed several tools in this area, including a pricing simulator for over 1,000 17th-century trade goods, and a program that generates characters' life stories based on their stats.

## Ryan Quest

I made [the text adventure *Ryan Quest*](https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/ryanquest) as a surprise birthday present for my best friend from college, Ryan Wright. The player controls Ryan in a parody of his real life. After doing all the writing, coding, and user testing, I flew out to surprise him with the game in person.
